            <h3>JAPAN ANECDOTES</h3>
            <p class="text">I have had a blog about trips to Japan for several years. At first, it was only a place to share my experiences travelling around the country, but it turned into a larger project: a platform where travellers contacted me to plan their trips to Japan.</p>
            <p class="text">Acting as a travel consultant, I spoke via Zoom with clients (mostly from the USA) to <strong>understand their preferences</strong> and tastes and answer questions. From there, I would make an <strong>initial design</strong> of their itinerary and we would discuss it and improve it until the client was satisfied. Only when the design was perfect, I would put together a <strong>personalized guide</strong> for each traveller and take care of accommodation and activity reservations.</p>
            <p class="text">Once in Japan, clients could contact me at any time if they needed help. For example, one time, when the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a typhoon warning for the following day at a client's holiday spot, I stayed up all night and changed her entire route to get her out of danger... as well as a plan C so she could choose her preferred option. I place a lot of importance on a client having the best possible experience when I am working with them, and of course not failing in the trust that has been given to me.</p>
            <p class="text">Since Covid I no longer accept new clients, so the site has remained a hobby project where I only work on the blog when I have the chance to visit Japan personally.</p>

            <p>The current website is made with <strong>Wordpress</strong>, although it is being improved with an HTML/CSS version that will soon replace the current website. I have also <strong>designed a travel guide</strong> including maps, illustrations and photos for those who choose to prepare their own trip.</p></br>
