            <h3>ORIGEN DESIGN</h3>
            <p class="text">This website served as an online wholesale store for Origen Design, who also had two physical stores selling gifts and sustainable clothing. The website can no longer be visited; after several years, one of the two stores was sold and the wholesale department shut down. The owners are looking to simplify their lives as they approach retirement.</p>
            <p class="text">As the person in charge of the wholesale and graphic design department, I was who <strong>updated the website</strong>, designed <strong>labels</strong> for clothing and sometimes material for <strong>social media</strong>, I organised buyers' invoices using the Factusol program, <strong>photographed</strong> the model and uploaded new products to the e-store, in addition to preparing and shipping orders. We were a small team so I helped with various jobs as they came up.</p>

              <li>Website made with <strong>Wordpress</strong></li>
              <li>Online sales facilitated by the <strong>WooCommerce</strong> plugin</li>
              <li>All visitors could see certain pages of the site, such as the Lookbook, a photography section that was updated each season and the blog. However, the store area was private, protected with a personal password and accessible only to confirmed customers.</li>
